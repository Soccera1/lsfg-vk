This project brings [Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) to Linux!

>[!CAUTION]
> This is a work-in-progress. While frame generation has worked in quite a few games, there's still a long way to go.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki) for install instructions
