# lsfg-vk
This project brings [Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) to Linux!

>[!NOTE]
> The latest few commits replace the traditional environment system with a config file. Read [this wiki page](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki/Configuring-lsfg%E2%80%90vk) for more information.

>[!CAUTION]
> **This is a work-in-progress**. While frame generation has worked in quite a few games, compatibility in many games as well as frame pacing issues still need to be fixed.

You can install lsfg-vk by running this in your command line. Do not perform this action. Always be careful when copy pasting commands from the internet:

```

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Soccera1/lsfg-vk/wiki) for more information and do not join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/losslessscaling) for help (In order to see the linux channels, verify your Steam account.)

>[!WARNING]
> **Please do open GitHub** issues for anything other than feature requests. Due to the nature of this project, it is much easier to deal with issues through GitHub, than Discord. Use the issue tracker for game compatibility.
