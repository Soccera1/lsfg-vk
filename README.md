# lsfg-vk
This project brings [Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) to Linux!

>[!CAUTION]
> **This is a work-in-progress**. While frame generation has worked in quite a few games, compatibility in many games as well as frame pacing issues still need to be fixed.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki) for install instructions and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/losslessscaling) for help (In order to see the linux channels, verify your Steam account.)

>[!WARNING]
> Please do note open GitHub issues for anything other than feature requests. Due to the nature of this project, it is much easier to deal with issues through Discord, than GitHub. Use the #linux-reports channel for game compatibility.
