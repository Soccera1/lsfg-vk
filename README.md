# lsfg-vk
This project brings [Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) to Linux!

>[!CAUTION]
> **This is a work-in-progress**. While frame generation has worked in quite a few games, compatibility in many games as well as frame pacing issues still need to be fixed.

You can install lsfg-vk by running this in your command line:
```bash
curl -sSf https://pancake.gay/lsfg-vk.sh | sh
```
<sup>Note: This script is extremely primitive and will not work on all distros. It has been written for Arch Linux and its derivations</sup>

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki) for more information and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/losslessscaling) for help (In order to see the linux channels, verify your Steam account.)

>[!WARNING]
> Please do not open GitHub issues for anything other than feature requests. Due to the nature of this project, it is much easier to deal with issues through Discord, than GitHub. Use the #linux-reports channel for game compatibility.
